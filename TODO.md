- [x] Update .github/scripts/requirements.txt: Add openai, remove autopep8 and isort
- [x] Rewrite .github/scripts/review_pr.py: Convert to local script that detects linter issues, uses OpenAI API (with user-provided API key via env var) to generate and apply fixes, creates new branch, commits changes, pushes to GitHub, creates PR using gh CLI
- [x] Update README.md: Describe the new local AI correction and PR creation process, including instructions to set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable (user must provide their own key)
- [x] Modify .github/workflows/ai-review.yml: Remove or disable PR triggers since the bot now runs locally
- [x] Install dependencies (pip install -r .github/scripts/requirements.txt)
- [x] Ensure GitHub CLI (gh) is installed for PR creation
- [ ] Test locally with bad_code.py: Run script to detect issues, generate AI fixes, apply them, and create a test PR (requires OPENAI_API_KEY to be set)
- [x] Update this TODO.md as tasks are completed
